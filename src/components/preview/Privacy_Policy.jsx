<h4 className="pt-3">The Way <strong>5Log</strong> Uses Information:
</h4>
<p>If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the <strong>5Log</strong> Site, or <strong>5Log</strong> Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the <strong>5Log</strong> Site and <strong>5Log</strong> Service. In particular, your mobile phone number is essential to your use of the <strong>5Log</strong> Service and will be retained. Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users if they tag your mobile number and access your ratings in the App. For more information on our ratings feature, please read the note below :
</p>
<p>
<strong>5Log</strong> will use your mobile number and contacts list to identify friends in your network who have rated establishments and/or are users of <strong>5Log</strong> Services. <strong>5Log</strong> collects ratings in the following ways :
</p>
  <p>When a user calls our service and is prompted to rate an establishment
When a user rates establishments on the website or mobile site or Applications
Where are the ratings shown ? Ratings are shown in the following ways on <strong>5Log</strong> :
</p> 
<p>In SMS when user asks for information by calling the <strong>5Log</strong> Service
Ratings are displayed on various places on the website, mobile site and mobile applications in pages such as the overall ratings count page, search results pages, company details pages etc. User information such as mobile phone number is masked and personally identifiable information is not displayed unless user is registered with <strong>5Log</strong> and is accessing the tag friends feature.
</p>  
<p>Ratings are shown in the "Tag your friend" feature available across <strong>5Log</strong> services platforms where user can access friends' ratings of establishments.
</p> 
<h4 className="pt-3">Benefits:
</h4>
<p>Your contacts list will allow <strong>5Log</strong> to provide you with ratings given by your friends and help make the experience on <strong>5Log</strong> even better. Your friends ratings will allow you to make a better decision about choosing a product/service/establishment on <strong>5Log</strong>.
</p>
<p>You can build your friends network and choose your friends on <strong>5Log</strong> and access your friends' ratings across the range of our platforms including mobile site, website and our applications.
</p>
<h4 className="pt-3">
How <strong>5Log</strong> uses your information:
</h4>
<p><strong>5Log</strong> "tags" the contacts in your address book as your friends, but at anytime, you can review the list of your tagged friends and choose to untag any of them at any time. Untagging your contacts will hide your ratings from them and will also result in their ratings not being shown to you.
</p>
<p>Only users of <strong>5Log</strong> will be displayed in your tagged friends list. If a contact in your address book has rated an establishment/s on <strong>5Log</strong>, the ratings associated with the contact will be displayed as part of your friends' ratings. If a contact in your address book has used <strong>5Log</strong>'s service across any platform and has not rated an establishment, although their name is displayed in your friends list, no ratings will be shown associated with the said contact.
</p>
<p>
If any of your tagged friends registers with our Service across <strong>5Log</strong>'s platforms, ratings of such a friend will be visible to you only if
</p>

<p>Your mobile number is present in his contacts list
You have not been untagged by your friend
<strong>5Log</strong> will also provide users with a privacy settings option that will allow the user to choose appropriate privacy levels. By default, the user's contact list will be used to identify friends in the network. A user may choose to allow anyone to tag him/her as a friend and may also choose to allow nobody to tag him/her as a friend.
